# chatbot-python-nltk

This code is using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network model for a chatbot. The neural network architecture used in this code is a simple feedforward neural network. The model has the following layers:

1. Input layer: Dense layer with 128 neurons and the 'relu' activation function.
2. Dropout layer: To prevent overfitting, with a dropout rate of 0.5.
3. Hidden layer: Dense layer with 64 neurons and the 'relu' activation function.
4. Dropout layer: To prevent overfitting, with a dropout rate of 0.5.
5. Output layer: Dense layer with neurons equal to the number of classes in the training data (i.e., the intents of the chatbot), and the 'softmax' activation function to produce probability distributions over the classes.

The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Nesterov momentum. The loss function used is 'categorical_crossentropy', and the model's performance is evaluated based on the 'accuracy' metric during training.

Please note that the exact architecture and hyperparameters can be modified and experimented with depending on the specific chatbot's requirements and the nature of the data.

Once the model is trained, it is saved as 'chatbot_model.h5' in the current directory. The model can be used to classify user input and generate responses based on the training data's patterns and intents.

This code assumes that there is a JSON file named 'intents.json' in the directory specified ('D:\Amey\Chatbot\intents.json') containing the data required for training the chatbot. The JSON file should have a specific structure, including patterns, tags (intents), and responses for the chatbot to learn from.
